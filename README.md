# Node.js-Stockfish-communication
A raw example of communication between node.js and stockfish


This just spawns a stockfish instance and sends basic commands.
Someone asked me to post it, but it's very raw. This can be made into a local analysis with a browser exntension.
Either native messaging or using a node server => communicating from Lichess analyzis window with a locally running Stockfish. Should be faster than the browser based binary.
